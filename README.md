# Mobile Landscape Scroll
## An product browse prototype experimenting with a mobile landscape scroll

- Best if used on a mobile device ([Available here](http://brianrberg.com/product-browse-experiment/landscape-scroll/index.html)).
	- Note: May not be up to date with this repo.
- Just flip your device into landscape to see a different browse experience.
- To view in browser, either resize browser to landscape proportions (less than 480px wide), or simply click the mobile icon to active a responsive widget ([From Victor Coulon](http://responsive.victorcoulon.fr/)).
